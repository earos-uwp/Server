    2. Probability equation
        Add up columns and count all the different possibilities and then divide by the total.
        Apply Filters to Columns
        Keep duplicate combinations

Connections:
    Serial: kind of like Single
    Diverging: parent is independent from it's children
    Converging: a child has 2 parents.
        not knowing the child makes the parents independent

Bayes' Theorem: If events E1, E2....En are MEEE's (each event are independent from each other) when P(Ei) = 0 for
    i = 1, 2...n. Then for any event B in S where P(B) != 0, then P(Er/B) = P(Er, B) / sum(P(Ei, B)).
        Note - sum(P(Ei, B)) = P(B).

Questions:
    1. Are classes independent?
        calculations will be different is so
            P(A/B) = P(A)
            P(A,B) = P(A)P(B)
