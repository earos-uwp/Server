From our original dataset we transformed the term gpa sheet to switch the rows and columns. We only kept the spring and fall semesters. Then, in Python, we used the Pandas library to create a dataframe of the gpa sheet. For each student id in the dataframe we created a temporary array of the terms which have non-zero GPAs. As long as a student id is related to at least 2 non-zero GPA terms then we continue for this student id. We then choose a random term (not the first) from the array and the term previous to that. We add these terms, along with the corresponding GPA values and the student id to a new dataframe. The final dataset has these values for each student id that has at least 2 terms of non-zero gpa.

Then sklearn was used to generate a 5-fold stratified testing/training dataset to be used for future models using the term number as a stratification classifier instead of gpa.
