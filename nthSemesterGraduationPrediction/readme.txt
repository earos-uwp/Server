These predictive models are used to predict if a student will graduate or not based on their 1st thru nth term gpa.
The only students in the datasets are ones that we have all freshman datafor, and either graduated or were dismissed and did not return. We found that every single student in our dataset who was dismissed and did not return did so in their first four terms, with every student but one having done so within the first three terms.
Therefore, we have three raw datasets for these predictive models. One for students who made it through their first term and eventually graduated and were dismissed without returning, another for students who made it through their second term and eventually graduated or were dismissed without returning, and a third for students who did similarly.
These datasets include the student's term GPA, term academic standing (1=NA, 2=Probation, 3=Dismissed, 4=Good), if they would eventually graduate (1=Yes, 0=No). Each of these three term datasets go through independent stratification and 5-fold separation.
